# Atom-Dev-Board
The Atom development board was a custom designed PCB based around the ATMEGA32u4 that runs the Arduino bootloader so that it can be easily programmed and monitored directly from the Arduino IDE. The goal of the project was to create an as small as possible Arduino development board using the ATMEGA32u4 which by it's own right is a rather powerful 8-bit AVR microcontroller with many built-in features and communication interfaces. The name Atom was chosen for this reason as the board is not only very tiny but also very powerful and useful.

*In the project's current state I am awaiting for the fabricated board to arrive from OSH park at which point I can begin assembly and then testing. This repository will be updated as soon as the board arrives from fabrication. (Updated: Aug. 27, 2018)*

*The board has returned from fabrication at OSHPark and came out as expected. Currently, I am just waiting for all of the parts to arrive from Mouser and then I'll begin assembly and testing. (Updated: September 9, 2018)*
